<div class='col-lg-12'><p class=\"lead\">Thanks to George, birthing partners are now better supported by maternity services in Bucks when mum is giving birth.</p>
<p>When his wife was giving birth, George felt that all the support was targeted at this wife and as a birthing partner, he was not given enough information before, during and after the birth to properly support her. Following his feedback to Healthwatch Bucks on his experience of maternity services, Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust has reviewed its maternity services to ensure the role of the partner is now firmly in mind. The Trust has also introduced a new policy stating that the birthing partner should not remain for more than 20 minutes without an update when separated from the mother.</br>
</br>
To celebrate George and others who have helped make a difference to health and social care services by sharing their views, weâ€™ve launched our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ItStartsWithYou\">#ItStartsWithYou</a> campaign. The more that people share their ideas, experiences and concerns about the NHS and social care, the more services can understand when improvements are needed. But, to make the biggest difference, we need to hear from more people.</br>
</br>
You can make a difference too. Join in by searching for a services below and sharing your experience with us.</p></div><div class='col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-12'><div class='widget widget_search'>" . get_search_form(false) . "</div></div>
